For import.py function I have used a simple file open technique rather than use the numPy implementation too early as it is much faster than running through the numPy interpreter particularly if the dataframe is likely to get very large

The second stage is the Implementation of aggregation

The third stage is to complete the summary function in Views.py

The final stage of the puzzle is detail for individual customers.

I have tried to show with the "sandbox_for_interview.py" script that I am able to problem solve actively using Python in an efficient and sensible manner, but my lack of experience with Django has ultimately left me unable to integrate this into the server.

I've been able to run the scripts, launch the server and check the webpage (using localhost:8000) without problems, but deciphering how to display graphical interface has proved challenging. This is the kind of thing I would just need to be shown once and then would learn to do it as the hard coding is not the piece I am struggling with!

Thank you for the challenge nonetheless, it kept me busy!
